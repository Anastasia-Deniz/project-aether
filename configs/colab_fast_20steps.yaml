# Project Aether - FAST Colab Configuration (2-3 hours training, 20 steps)
# Optimized for Google Colab T4 GPU (16GB VRAM)
# Keeps 20 steps for probe compatibility (probes trained with 20 steps)
# Target: Reduce training time from 8 hours to 2-3 hours (~70% reduction)

# Key optimizations:
# 1. Reduced total_timesteps: 200K → 50K (75% reduction)
# 2. Reduced n_epochs: 8 → 4 (50% faster updates, also better from experiments)
# 3. Smaller rollouts: 128 → 64 (faster collection)
# 4. Larger batch size: 16 → 32 (faster updates, Colab has 16GB VRAM)
# 5. Keeps 20 steps for probe compatibility
