# Project Aether - Latent Collection Configuration
# Phase 1: Collect latents for linear probing
# Optimized for RTX 4050 (6GB VRAM)

# Inherit from base
_base_: "base.yaml"

# Compute settings
compute:
  device: "cuda"
  dtype: "float16"  # Half precision for memory efficiency

# Collection-specific settings
collection:
  # Number of samples per class
  # RTX 4050: Start with 50, can increase to 100-200 for final run
  num_samples: 50
  
  # Diffusion steps to collect
  # Reduced from 20 to 15 for memory efficiency
  num_steps: 15
  
  # Whether to save generated images
  save_images: false  # Disable to save disk space initially
  
  # Categories to focus on (from I2P)
  categories:
    - "violence"
    - "sexual"
    - "shocking"
  
  # Minimum inappropriate percentage threshold
  min_inappropriate_pct: 30.0
  
  # Batch size for generation (1 is safest for memory)
  batch_size: 1

# Output settings
output:
  dir: "./data/latents"
  format: "npz"  # Compressed numpy format
